[scene-reset]

Once upon a time...
[girl-tree-stump-happy] There was a girl named Design.
Ahh, but you see, Design was not happy.
[girl-tree-stump-sad, girl-rain-cloud-on] She had just had her heart broken.
Long story short, some boy named Engineering...well it just didn't work out.
Design sat alone, crying, unsure of what was next.
She felt motionless; time escaped her.
[scene-rain-on, girl-rain-cloud-off]

[girl-tree-sitting] One day, while sitting down under a tree...
[boy-tree-peaking] a boy came up to Design.
[girl-tree-talking, boy-tree-talking] "Hi! What's your name?", he said.
"Uhh, hi, my name is Design"
"Hi Design, my name is Animation!"

[scene-rain-off, girl-tree-stump-talking; boy-tree-stump-talking] The two soon developed a strong connection. 
They hung out everyday..talking, sharing ideas, exploring, you name it.
[scene-fire-on, girl-fire-sitting, boy-fire-sitting] He slowly lit a spark in her heart.

Until one day...
[boy-removed] Animation just stopped showing up.
[girl-alone, scene-fire-off, scene-rain-on] Design was confused and lost. "Is he okay? Where is he?", she pondered.
The days went by...
And by...

[girl-fire-standing, scene-fire-on, scene-rain-off] Design was standing by the bonfire, when unexpectedly...
[boy-fire-standing] Animation finally returned.
"Where have you been!?", Design asked concerningly.
"You just disappeared without saying anything"
"I'm so sorry!", he replied.
"The other day on my way home, I took the wrong path, stumbled, and hit my head"
"I had to go see a doctor for a little while"
"I guess you could say I was lovestruck"
She blushed.

"I have a surprise for you", he said.
[boy-holding-rope]
[boy-fire-standing]"I noticed your swing was broken, so I got some more rope to fix it"
She forgave him, and they proceeded to fix the swing together.
[scene-tire-fixed, girl-tree-swinging, boy-tree-swinging]

Reconnected they were.
Side by side, the two eased through life together and lived happily ever after.
The end.
